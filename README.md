# razer_thirdpartysdk_ios
The Third Party SDK Framework for iOS used to Login with Razer ID.
Download this Framework and Add in your sample App to test Login with razer ID. (For reference , you can download the sample app from this link which is using this framework to Login : https://github.com/razerofficial/razer_sdk_ios_sample) 


As per appstore guidelines, they dont support simulator Architecture during delpoying the App to Appstore. So , created two folders , one for development (which includes device and simulator architecture support), other for App store which is same but exclude Simulator Architecture support).

For step by Step instructions to set up your App , use this link :
